# my-shadow-audits
This repository collects my work shadowing competitive smart contract audits from platforms like Code4rena. Every contest I audit includes:

- **Pre-audit notes**: My initial thoughts before official findings.
- **Post-audit review**: Comparison with official results.
- **Exploit tests**: Hardhat/Foundry tests demonstrating issues.
- **Reflections**: What I learned and how my checklist evolves.
